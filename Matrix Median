Problem Description

Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M in which each row is sorted.

Find and return the overall median of matrix A.

NOTE: No extra memory is allowed.

NOTE: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 10^5

1 <= N*M <= 10^6

1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

N*M is odd



Input Format
The first and only argument given is the integer matrix A.



Output Format
Return the overall median of matrix A.



Example Input
Input 1: 

A = [   [1, 3, 5],
        [2, 6, 9],
        [3, 6, 9]   ] 
Input 2: 

A = [   [5, 17, 100]    ]


Example Output
Output 1: 

 5 
Output 2: 

 17


Example Explanation
Explanation 1: 

A = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 9, 9]
Median is 5. So, we return 5. 
Explanation 2:

Median is 17.

Solution:

class Solution:
	# @param A : list of list of integers
	# @return an integer
	def findMedian(self, A):
        l=[]
        for i in A:
            for j in i:
                l.append(j)
        l.sort()
        if len(l)%2!=0:
            return l[len(l)//2]
